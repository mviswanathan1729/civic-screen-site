      <h2>How Civic Screen Works</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Screen is designed to be simple, predictable, and easy to operate in shared public spaces.
        It helps community organizations display timely information across multiple screens—without
        advertising, tracking, or unnecessary complexity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>One System, Many Communities</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Screen acts as a central digital bulletin board for multiple community organizations.
        Each organization manages its own content and displays it across screens in different locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A library, church, or community center may each use Civic Screen independently, while
        displaying information tailored to their own spaces.
      </p>

      <h2>Visual Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The diagram below shows how Civic Screen supports multiple community organizations,
        each with several display locations such as front desks, meeting rooms, and outdoor areas.
      </p>

          Each client includes multiple display locations.

      <h2>Displays Use Standard Web Browsers</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Screen runs as a lightweight web application and can be displayed using a standard
        web browser on TVs, monitors, or tablets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once configured, screens run unattended and automatically rotate through announcements,
        events, and other community information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tailored Per Location</h2>
      <p>
        Each display can be configured to show the information most relevant to its location.
        For example, a front desk screen may focus on announcements and today’s events, while
        a meeting room display may highlight schedules and upcoming activities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Designed for Reliability and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Civic Screen is built to run continuously in public environments and to recover gracefully
        from restarts or network interruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not track viewers, collect personal data, or rely on third-party advertising or analytics platforms.
